# Homework 5 script
# Instructions:

#The following script was written for Python 3, and it is in my HW5 subdirectory on the bioinfo server. 

1. Specify the sequences to open from the command line
```
2. homework5_sequences = input("Type name of sequence file here, please: ")
```
3. Create an outfile to save the sequences to
```
homework5_out = open('homework5_out.txt', 'w')
```

4. Write the lines individually in the outfile
```
with open(homework5_sequences, 'r') as HW5Seq:
    for line in HW5Seq:
        homework5_out.write(line)
```
5. In the with statement, each line of the input file is read using a for loop, and the contents of each line are written to the output file using the write() method.


6. Use `scp` command to copy my outfile to my local computer
```
scp bioinfo@10.31.60.11:/Users/bioinfo/Bioinformatics_Spring_2023/Gause_Carol/HW5/homework5_out.txt .
```
